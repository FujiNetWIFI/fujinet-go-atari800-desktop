"""Assert that a WITH_ATARI800_ROMS=OFF binary really carries no Atari ROM.

This is the test that makes the COMPLIANCE.md claim checkable rather than
aspirational: it takes a distinctive slice out of each ROM image in
tools/roms and greps the built binary for it. Anything found is a ROM
that got compiled in despite the option, which would make the artifact
non-redistributable.

Atari's operating systems, BASIC and the peripherals' ROMs are copyrighted
firmware, so a WITH_ATARI800_ROMS=OFF binary is expected to contain none of
them (the built-in AltirraOS and Altirra BASIC are not in tools/roms) -- see
COMPLIANCE.md. A .zip in the ROM directory is looked inside.
