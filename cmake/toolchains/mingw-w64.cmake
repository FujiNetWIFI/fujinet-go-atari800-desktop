# Cross-compile Windows from Linux.
#
# Not a substitute for the native MSYS2 build CI runs, but it catches the
# Windows-only translation units -- the Win32 frontend above all --
# at the desk rather than on a push. The sibling ports learned to keep one of
# these because "the Windows frontend was developed on Linux" is otherwise a
# euphemism for "the Windows build was never compiled".
#
# SDL3 comes from SDL's own prebuilt mingw devel archive rather than a
# from-source build; point CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH at its x86_64 tree and it is
# added to the find root below:
#
#   curl -LO https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/download/release-3.4.12/SDL3-devel-3.4.12-mingw.tar.gz
#   tar xzf SDL3-devel-3.4.12-mingw.tar.gz
#   cmake -B build-win -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/toolchains/mingw-w64.cmake \
#         -DFRONTEND=windows -DWITH_FUJINET=OFF \
#         -DZLIB_ROOT=<a mingw zlib prefix> \
#         -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$PWD/SDL3-3.4.12/x86_64-w64-mingw32"
#   cmake --build build-win
#
# Running the result under Wine wants SDL3.dll beside the exe:
#
#   cp SDL3-3.4.12/x86_64-w64-mingw32/bin/SDL3.dll build-win/frontends/windows/
#   WINEPATH=/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/bin wine build-win/frontends/windows/fujinet-go-atari800-windows.exe
